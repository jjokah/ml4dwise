The digital age is undeniably entering an era dominated by artificial intelligence (AI). To achieve this level of intelligence, machines must be taught, or trained. This is where machine learning (ML) comes in. It empowers computers to learn from data without explicit programming, enabling them to identify patterns and make predictions based on the information provided.\nEveryone’s unique knowledge, experience, and expertise are invaluable in developing these intelligent machines. For instance, the input of a doctor is crucial for creating an AI that can detect early stages of cancer. AI is poised to revolutionize every field, alleviating drudgery and boosting productivity, ultimately redefining the nature of work.\nWhile there’s speculation about AI taking jobs, the reality is stark: 100% of jobs will be impacted. However, there’s good news for two groups: those who leverage AI to enhance their productivity and those who build it. This course empowers you to both harness the power of AI and contribute to its development.\nHere’s the course curriculum, designed to equip the wise with the necessary skills to build intelligent machines.

    "text": "The Print Function\nThe very first thing that every programmer learns is how to print something off using that programming language. In most tutorials, you will see the phrase “Hello, World!” used. In this textbook, let’s try something a bit different. Let’s say I wanted to print off “Hello, William”. We can do this in Python by using the print function. The print function lets us print off some piece of data. In our case, that piece of data will be a piece of text, known as a string (see below). Our text is “Hello, William”. The thing that we want to print off must be located between an open parentheses and a close parentheses. Let’s try to execute the print command in the cell below.\n\nprint(\"Hello, William!\")\n\nHello, William!\n\n\nAs we can see, the code that we typed in the Jupyter cell outputted beneath it. Now, it is your turn. Try to print off something. In order to print off text, you will need to use an open and a close quotation mark. We will learn more about this as we meet strings in the next chapter.\n\nfrom IPython.display import IFrame\nIFrame('https://trinket.io/embed/python3/3fe4c8f3f4', 700, 500)\n\n\n        \n        \n\n\nThis has worked wonderfully, but what if our Python notebook needs to be more dynamic, meaning it needs to adjust based on some user input. Perhaps, we need to use a name other than William based on some user-defined input. To do this, we would need to store a piece of data in memory. We can do this in Python by creating a variable that will point to an object. Before we get into how this is done, let’s first get to know objects and variables."

These two words, object and variable mean slightly different things, but are often used interchangeably. We will not get into the complexities of their differences and why they exist in this textbook, but for now, view an object as something that is created by a Python script and stored in your computer’s memory so that it can be used later in a program.\nThink of your computer’s memory rather like your own brain. Imagine if you needed to remember what the word for “hello” in German. You may use your memory rather like a flashcard, where “hello” in English equates to “hallo” in German. In Python, we create objects in a similar way. The object would be the dictionary entry of “hello: hallo”."

    "text": "Variables\nIn order to reference this dictionary entry in memory, we need a way to reference it. We do this with a variable. The variable is simply the name of the item in our script that will point to that object in memory. Variables make it so that we can have an easy-to-remember name to reference, call, and change that object in memory.\nVariables can be created by typing a unique word, followed by an = sign, followed by the specific data. As we will learn throughout this chapter, there are many types of data that are created differently. Let’s create our first object before we begin. This will be a string, or a piece of text. (We will learn about these in more detail below.) In my case, I want to create the object author. I want author to be associated with my name in memory. In the cell, or block of code, below, let’s do this.\n\nauthor = \"William Mattingly\"\n\nExcellent! We have created our first object. Now, it is time to use that object. Below, we will learn about ways we can manipulate strings, but for now, let’s simply see if that object exists in memory. We can do this with the print function.\nThe print function will become your best friend in Python. It is, perhaps, the function I use most commonly. The reason for this is because the print function allows for you to easily debug, or identify problems and fix them, within your code. It allows us to print off objects that are stored in memory.\nTo use the print function, we type the word print followed by an open parentheses. After the open parentheses, we place the object or that piece of data that we want to print. After that, we close the function with the close parentheses. Let’s try to print off our new object author to make sure it is in memory.\n\nprint(author)\n\nWilliam Mattingly\n\n\nNotice that when I execute the cell above, I see an output that relates to the object we created above. What would happen if I tried to print off that object, but I used a capital letter, rather than a lowercase one at the beginning, so Author, rather than author?"

This mistake teaches us two things. First, Python is case sensitive. This means that if any object (or string) will need to be matched in not only letters, but also the case of those letters. Second, this mistake teaches us that we can only call objects that have been created and stored in memory.\nNow that we have the variable pointing to a specific piece of data, we can make our print function above a bit more dynamic. Let’s try and print off the same statement as before, but with the new full author name. I don’t expect you to understand the specifics of the code below, rather simply understand that we will frequently need to store variables in memory so that we can use them later in our programs.\n\nprint(f\"Hello, {author}!\")\n\nHello, William Mattingly!"

    "text": "Built-in Types\nIn addition to reserve words, there are also built-in types in Python. These are words that you can use (as we will see) to convert one type of data into another. There are 94 of these in total. Unlike reserve words, you can use a built-in type as a variable name. It is, however, strongly discouraged to do so because it will overwrite the intended use of these variable names in your script.\n\nimport builtins\n[getattr(builtins, d) for d in dir(builtins) if isinstance(getattr(builtins, d), type)]\n\n[ArithmeticError,\n AssertionError,\n AttributeError,\n BaseException,\n BlockingIOError,\n BrokenPipeError,\n BufferError,\n BytesWarning,\n ChildProcessError,\n ConnectionAbortedError,\n ConnectionError,\n ConnectionRefusedError,\n ConnectionResetError,\n DeprecationWarning,\n EOFError,\n OSError,\n Exception,\n FileExistsError,\n FileNotFoundError,\n FloatingPointError,\n FutureWarning,\n GeneratorExit,\n OSError,\n ImportError,\n ImportWarning,\n IndentationError,\n IndexError,\n InterruptedError,\n IsADirectoryError,\n KeyError,\n KeyboardInterrupt,\n LookupError,\n MemoryError,\n ModuleNotFoundError,\n NameError,\n NotADirectoryError,\n NotImplementedError,\n OSError,\n OverflowError,\n PendingDeprecationWarning,\n PermissionError,\n ProcessLookupError,\n RecursionError,\n ReferenceError,\n ResourceWarning,\n RuntimeError,\n RuntimeWarning,\n StopAsyncIteration,\n StopIteration,\n SyntaxError,\n SyntaxWarning,\n SystemError,\n SystemExit,\n TabError,\n TimeoutError,\n TypeError,\n UnboundLocalError,\n UnicodeDecodeError,\n UnicodeEncodeError,\n UnicodeError,\n UnicodeTranslateError,\n UnicodeWarning,\n UserWarning,\n ValueError,\n Warning,\n OSError,\n ZeroDivisionError,\n _frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter,\n bool,\n bytearray,\n bytes,\n classmethod,\n complex,\n dict,\n enumerate,\n filter,\n float,\n frozenset,\n int,\n list,\n map,\n memoryview,\n object,\n property,\n range,\n reversed,\n set,\n slice,\n staticmethod,\n str,\n super,\n tuple,\n type,\n zip]\n\n\nOf this long list, I recommend paying particular attention to the ones that you are more likely to write naturally: bool, dict, float, int, list, map, object, property, range, reversed, set, slice, str, super, tuple, type, and zip. You are more likely to use these as variable names by accident than, say, ZeroDivisionError; and this shorter list is a lot easier to memorize."

    "text": "Bugs\nThroughout your programming career, you will often read or hear about bugs. A bug is a problem in your code that either returns an error or an unintended result in the output. Tracing down bugs and fixing them is known as debugging. Aside from figuring out how to code solutions to problems, debugging can be one of the more time-consuming aspects of writing a program, especially if it is quite complex. Throughout this textbook, we will encounter common errors so that you can see them in this controlled space. We will also walk through what the error means and how to resolve it. That said, you are likely to create many other bugs as you try to apply the code in this textbook to your own data. That is expected. Always remember to read each line of your Python code carefully and, if you have an error message, identify where the error is coming from and what it is."

    "section": "Why Python",
    "text": "Why Python\n\nRich Libraries\nOne of Python’s greatest strengths lies in its extensive ecosystem of specialized libraries and frameworks for machine learning and AI. Libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn provide robust foundations for developing sophisticated machine learning models. NumPy offers powerful tools for numerical computing, while Pandas excels at data manipulation and analysis. These libraries, maintained by both tech giants and the open-source community, provide pre-built components that significantly reduce development time and complexity.\n\n\n\neasy-python-just-import\n\n\n\n\nEasy to Learn and Use\nPython’s syntax is remarkably intuitive and readable, often described as “pseudocode that runs.” This characteristic is particularly valuable in machine learning, where complex algorithms and mathematical concepts need to be translated into executable code. The language’s emphasis on readability and simplicity means that developers can focus on solving machine learning problems rather than wrestling with complicated syntax.\nConsider this simple example of a machine learning model in Python:\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n\n# Split data and train model\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)\nmodel = LinearRegression()\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\nThe code above is self-explanatory even to those with basic programming knowledge, demonstrating Python’s emphasis on clarity and simplicity.\n\n\nThriving Open-Source Community\nPython’s open-source nature has fostered a vibrant, collaborative community that continuously contributes to its growth. This community-driven development has resulted in: - Regular updates and improvements to existing libraries - Extensive documentation and tutorials - Quick bug fixes and security patches - Readily available support through forums and discussion boards\nThe collaborative spirit of Python’s community has accelerated innovation in AI and machine learning, making cutting-edge technologies more accessible to developers worldwide.\n\n\n\npython, most popular on github\n\n\n\n\nWidespread Popularity\nPython’s popularity in the AI and ML space creates a positive feedback loop: more developers using Python leads to more resources, tools, and job opportunities, which in turn attracts more developers. According to recent surveys, Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, particularly in data science and machine learning roles. This widespread adoption means: - Abundant learning resources - Large talent pool for organizations - Extensive code examples and solutions - Regular updates and maintenance of ML libraries\n\n\nPlatform Independence\nPython’s cross-platform compatibility is crucial for machine learning applications that need to run in various environments. Whether developing on Windows, macOS, or Linux, Python code remains consistent and portable. This platform independence enables: - Seamless deployment across different operating systems - Easy scaling from development to production - Consistent performance across platforms - Flexibility in choosing development and deployment environments\nPython provides the tools, resources, and ecosystem necessary for the wise the opportunity of building intelligent machines."
