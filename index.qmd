Machine Learning For The Wise - **ML4DWISE**

![**ML4DWISE**](asset/img/m4w.jpg)

This course is designed for those who desire to seize the opportunity of building intelligent machines â€“ _a pursuit reserved for the wise_. The digital age is undeniably entering an era dominated by artificial intelligence (AI). To achieve this level of intelligence, machines must be taught, or trained. This is where machine learning (ML) comes in. It empowers computers to learn from data without explicit programming, enabling them to identify patterns and make predictions based on the information provided.

Everyone's unique knowledge, experience, and expertise are invaluable in developing these intelligent machines. For instance, the input of a doctor is crucial for creating an AI that can detect early stages of cancer. AI is poised to revolutionize every field, alleviating drudgery and boosting productivity, ultimately redefining the nature of work.

While there's speculation about AI taking jobs, the reality is stark: 100% of jobs will be impacted. However, there's good news for two groups: **those who leverage AI** to enhance their productivity **and those who build it**. This course empowers you to both harness the power of AI and contribute to its development.

Here's the course curriculum, designed to equip _the wise_ with the necessary skills to build intelligent machines. It progresses from problem solving with Python, to super-charged productivity by leveraging AI, and then to building intelligent machines with ML, culminating in a practical capstone project.
